After submitting my PhD thesis in last February, I successfully defended my doctorate during my viva voce on the 1st May, 2024. The examination board was composed of the two examiners, Pr. Robert Marsh and Dr. Conor Cahalane, and the jury chair, Dr. Pauline Cullen. I would like to thank them. Also, I would like to thank Dr. Gerard McCarthy, for being a fantastic supervisor throughout my PhD.

My thesis is entitled **Coastal sea-level changes driven by oceanic and atmospheric circulation**. It includes work on the role played by the Gulf Stream and Kuroshio in driving coastal sea-level changes, as well as studies of sea level and oceanic circulation in the shelf regions around France, Ireland and the United Kingdom.
