A souvenir from Cotonou, Benin, with the other students from the Master 2 'Océanographie et applications'. This picture was taken in December 2018.

<!--more-->
I keep very good memories of my year in Benin, where I pursued my formation in physical oceanography between 2018 and 2019.

This picture was taken in December 2018, in front of the building of the International Chair in Mathematical Physics and Applications (ICMPA), where the courses took place. From left to right: Fernand Assene, Guy-Edgar Milend Mbeh, Thierry Derol Awoulmbang Sakpak, Catherine Jeandel (lecturer, CNRS, Toulouse), Wilfried Domingo, Adeola Dahunsi, Arnaud Kouekam, Léonard Worou, and me. We graduated in September 2019.

Most of us now work in oceanography, meteorology, or related fields. In particular,
- Fernand works on turbulent mixing and internal tides in the equatorial Atlantic. His first lead-authored paper can be accessed here https://doi.org/10.3390/fluids5030147.
- Arnaud works on dynamical changes of sandy beach in the Gulf of Guinea. Last research can be seen here: https://doi.org/10.1190/INT-2021-0023.1.
- Thierry and Adeola have co-authored papers which can be found online.
- Keep an eye out for the others!

Cheers,

S.
