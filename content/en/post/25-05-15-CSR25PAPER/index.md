In this work, we ask whether the circulation changes recorded at various moorings on and around the Northwest European Shelf are related to the sea-level variability on the shelf. Focusing on timescales shorter than a year, we show the shelf sea-level variability is wind-driven and that it indeed is directly affecting long-shore current variability. These longshore current changes are found on the outer-shelf and only impinge on the upper slope.

In addition, this paper wouldnâ€™t have been possible without numerous efforts in Ireland, UK and France, in collecting and sharing mooring data.
